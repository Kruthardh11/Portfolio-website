## Description

This project is a personal portfolio website that showcases my work, skills, and experience. It provides an interactive and visually appealing interface to present my projects, blog posts, and contact information. The website is built using Next.js, a React framework, and styled with Tailwind CSS for efficient and responsive design.

## Features
